<p>This is my personal blog. It will be mostly about software development, software "engineering", computer science, computer programming, computer games, and other computery things, but I reserve the right to write about whatever the hell I feel like.</p>

<p>My name is Richard William Eggert II, but you can call me Rich. I am a software engineer. A software engineer is a fancy term for someone who creates computer software but has a Master&#8217;s Degree in "Electrical and Computer Engineering" and doesn&#8217;t want to feel like he wasted 5 years of his life by going into software development instead of designing cool hardware or nuclear power plants or whatever. I could call myself a "software developer" or "computer programmer", but the former are typically associated with people who make software products, and nobody under the age of 50 calls himself the latter unless he&#8217;s a code monkey. I&#8217;ve spent my entire career working for contracting/consulting companies, so I could call myself a consultant, but consultants have gotten a bad reputation over the years, whereas the term "engineer" implies someone who is serious about doing things correctly.</p>

<h2 id="_why_the_hell_does_it_look_like_this">Why the hell does it look like this?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So after agonizing over the decision for several days, I finally settled on HubPress for my blogging platform. It&#8217;s very straightforward to set up, and it&#8217;s is built on top of GitHub Pages, so I retain full control over the raw source of my content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other options I considered:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>TinyPress - It&#8217;s sort of similar to HubPress in that it&#8217;s built on top of GitHub, but you manage your content through a separate site, which didn&#8217;t sit right with me, and I found the UI to be a bit underwhelming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll - I was really looking forward to having full control over all my content and just using Jekyll to render it for me, but when I tried to install Bundler on my local machine as they suggested, I got a weird error message and gave up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Straight Markdown on GitHub - This idea was inspired by Viktor Klang, who recently started using this for his <a href="https://github.com/viktorklang/blog">blog</a> instead of <a href="http://klangism.tumblr.com">Tumblr</a>, but it just seemed too klunky, and I was afraid it would just confuse readers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various hosted services, such as Tumblr, WordPress, etc. - However, I wanted something a bit more technically-oriented, as well as to retain full control over the source (and therefore content and appearance).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m still tweaking the appearance, so expect things to be in flux for a little while until I settle on a look that I like.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_when_the_hell_are_you_going_to_get_to_the_good_stuff">When the hell are you going to get to the good stuff?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the obligatory "first post" announcing the blog and explaining its purpose. I plan to start writing a real technical article shortly and post it as soon as it is ready. Anyway, world, here I am. I hope this blog turns out to be everything you ever imagined it could be and more!</p>
